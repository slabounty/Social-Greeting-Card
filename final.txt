OK, since I had such a hard time with this, I wanted to show everyone what the
final version looked like. A good part of the reason I had such a hard time
firguring this out, was the fact that the rails console didn't seem to be
reloading things correctly as I made changes. I didn't realize this until I
gave up one night, came back the next morning and the case that had been
working the previous night wasn't and the case that wasn't working was. 

The migration is the same, but I'll repeat it for completeness sake.

    def change
        create_table :signatures do |t|
            t.integer :signer_id
            t.integer :card_id
            t.boolean :signed,    :default => false
            t.text :message

            t.timestamps
        end
    end

The Signature class has the two belongs_to with card being the case that
normally gets shown in the examples and the signer being of type user.

    class Signature < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :card
        belongs_to :signer, :class_name => "User"
    end

The User has many signatures (necessary even if you don't use them directly)
an dmany signed_cards through signatures with a source of card (telling Rails
which class type the signed_cards are.

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :signatures, :foreign_key => "signer_id"
        has_many :signed_cards, :through => :signatures, :source => :card 
    end

Finally, the Card has many signatures (once again necessary) and many signers
through signatures and the foreign_key for the signer of signer_id.

    class Card < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :signatures
        has_many :signers, :through => :signatures, :foreign_key => 'signer_id'
    end

Hopefully, this will help others having similar issues.
